so basically
ctrl+alt+s, select github, and log in for computer
to save changes look on the left bar under project where it says commit
and click commit and push

btw a remote project url is just the url of the github repository you want to update to

and if you changed any files remotely
then press ctrl+0t, click "merge incoming changes into the current branch", and select OK
and wow
